# 🎓 Academic Credential Verification System

## 🔗 Overview
The **Academic Credential Verification System** is a **blockchain-powered web application** that ensures the secure issuance and verification of academic credentials. It eliminates **degree fraud** by leveraging blockchain technology to store credentials in a tamper-proof and decentralized manner.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Issue Credentials** – Institutions can issue verified degrees securely.
- ✅ **Verify Credentials** – Employers or organizations can instantly verify credentials.
- ✅ **View Blockchain** – Displays all issued credentials stored on the blockchain.
- ✅ **Decentralized & Secure** – Credentials are immutable and cannot be altered.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)  
- **Blockchain:** Custom-built blockchain (Python)  
- **Database:** Blockchain acts as a decentralized ledger  

## 🔍 How It Works?
1️⃣ **Institution Issues Credential** → Admin enters student details & adds to the blockchain.  
2️⃣ **Credential is Stored** → The system mines a new block containing the credential.  
3️⃣ **Anyone Can Verify** → Users enter student details to check authenticity.  
4️⃣ **Blockchain Ensures Security** → Credentials cannot be altered once stored.
